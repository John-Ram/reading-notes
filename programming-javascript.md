-There. I just explained programming **JavaScript** in a nutshell using a Rick and Morty reference. You're welcome.


-In more detail though, **JavaScript** is more complex than that. Remember when you were first learning to ride a bike or filling out your resume for the first time? Wasn't easy was it. Now imaginine that you didn't even know what that bike was before you tried getting on it. The bike is **HTML**, the paint on it is **CSS**, and the pedals, brakes and gears are **JavaScript**. The purpose of **JavaScript** is to make your website interactive with the user. When you are prompted to input your username onto a website and you are asked security questions, then you see your username on said site. That's **JavaScript** interacting with your user.

-So what else could you do with the power of **JavaScript**? Animations, Cool buttons for links, a personalized loading screen, ETC. There are so many things you can do with **JavaScript**. The key thing to remember is that you have to tell it what you want it to do, when to do it, and what to do after that task. You are teaching your website to do things instead of just being a pretty bird that can't fly or anything.
