#Code 102 Day one:

-The main thing to learn is to keep an open mind to new forms of learning. 
like in many fields, things don't always go to plan. When that happens don't be afraid, ask for help. 
I feel that is one of the harder things to get down, mainly because people are trained from childhood to rely on themselves and not bother others when you're falling behind.
Keep an eye on your software, make sure you are actually running the most current software. Your computer wont always be up-to-date automatically.

-I would be lying if i didn't say that this is all very intimidating and i often had to take a step back to calm down. 
Merely trying to get setup caused a lot of stress. I personally know i need to work on this.
So why would i recommend this to someone else who doesn't know what they're doing?
It's because in a way, we all don't know what were doing and part of the satisfaction is overcoming these challenges.
This class is gonna be fun, once i gain a better understanding of how to use the tools at my disposal.
Once you gain a better that foothold, the work is actually a lot of fun, so dont be intimidated into stopping, keep at it.


Markdown is a great tool to have, and given how simple it is, it helps take some of the edge off in order to focus on your tasks.
