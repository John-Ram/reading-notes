## Maps, primitives, File I/O

*Code 401: Class 3*

boolean – 1 bit
byte – 8 bits
short, char – 16 bits
int, float – 32 bits
long, double – 64 bits

The above is the memory footprints of primitive type values, but these can increase in bits depending on the Virtual Machine that implements them. while these are the defaults their memory increases depending on the usage and elements given in arrays. good practice is to use the right amount but leave some room incase of unexpected additions. that said dont always use long, double for everything.

Another cool feature is *scanner* which you could use to collect text into a readable format or add up different outputs into one large one. but depending on the outcome you want like adding up numbers for totals in thousands or with decimals, be sure to use the US locale.

don't forget to try out different combos to see how they mix or if they can! as understanding is the key to learning!
