## Linked Lists

*Code 401-Java: Class 4*

> "Coolios! so that means if you animated a circular linked list with a Big O notation of O(n) you'd essentially have an Ouroboros! as the beginning is at its end and will dynamically grow or shrink as time goes on and different sized files are fed to it! XD"

Psst, hey, you know your terminal? the one you cd into different directories and can add or remove files of varying sizes and have to traverse from a static starting point? that's a linked list, specifically a doubly linked list as you can go forward or backwards. It's not an array as that has to have its memory set beforehand, but not our linked-list, it knows you're adding new files every day and that you're willing to go from home to your readme files at the end of your path to add a new file talking about how each letter is 1 byte of memory. so as of writing this my post costs 114 bytes.
