## Arrays, Loops, Imports

*Code 401-Java: Class 2*

in the previous blog i talked about how different Java was to Javascript. Javascript is basically Java-lite, why? because apart from what i mentioned previously, another core thing about java is imports. An import in java is a memory-saving way to only use what you need for your program. the language has a fort know armory's worth of options to create and run the programs the way you want it. you can do general imports with * and the machine will only grab what it needs to run your program. this doesn't work for the import's subdirectories, those you need to write specifically.

another notable thing Java are the various types of loops at your disposal, for me a notable one was the do-while loop which as the name implies it means do A while B is happening. like say you wanted a countdown timer to but wanted the terminal to show it, you'd printIn and it'll print the numbers while it does the countdown loop.
