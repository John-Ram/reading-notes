-**JavaScript**, the interactive interface with the user. **JavaScript** can help make your Content more in touch with the user. You can Program it to tell time or say "good morning" depending on the time of day. In older Code, it used to be the norm to write the java or "script" as refered to in your **HTML**. Nowadays that's not the case, you'd link it into your webpage having it be independent from your HTML. A major benefit especially for large teams working on sites with lots of webpages is that with the **JavaScript** being in it's own folder you only have to link it to each page vs. copying to each individual site creating an increased possibility for errors. That said there are some cases where you might need to imput the script directly.

-Interactions can be rather simple like a *"hello"* or complex like seeing a giant super robot hyperforce go! shine your name into the cloudy skies of Gotham. But they both allow the user to feel more connected with the site allowing for a more pleasant experiance. how complex depends on the site and the amount of work you need to do. its preference or up to the customer you're making the site for, promoting the Indigogo Brothers movie! "fighting crime with the color blue."
