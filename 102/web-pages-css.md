## Web Page Design with CSS

-Now that we have built our sculpture, it's time to paint it and make it vivid. That's **CSS**. This program is different in a few manners, **HTML** is the frame but **CSS** is the body, the paint. Where **HTML** you have to right your code in order otherwise it looks iffy. **CSS** can be in different orders depending on what you're writing. **CSS** works in the fact that it is telling a website *"Hey I wanna make my title bold and i want my letters yellow.*" This is because **CSS** is assigning A to do B. 

-Example:

>h1 {
    color: rgb(248, 244, 244);
    text-align: center;
    font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
>}

-The above is telling my H1 Header *"Hey please make it the color white, have it be in the Center of the page, and have it be in this font."* but unless i put this " * " symbol instead of the H1, It will only apply to the header and not the whole page. As previously mentioned, having the **Live Server** tool in my Vscode is an invaluable tool while working on my webpage, I gave myself 10 minutes to play with **CSS** and was able to see the changes in real-time allowing my inner interior decorator have fun with all the options at my fingertips. If you're not so colorfully inclined do not fret for the world's got ya covered. Color mixers like [this](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp?colorhex=955251) are available to help you find a nice color mixture for your website. 

-You don't have to be Da Vinci or Picasso to create a nice webpage, go out and make your site yours!
