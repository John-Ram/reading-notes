**To keep myself in the Growth Mindset i do the following:**

1.*Look up stuff like cars or boat on craigslist.*

-This aids my head in commiting to growth, as it allows me to see what i can gain when i succeed. It's like waving a treat to your dog, its more inclined to be trained.

2.*Allow your mind to decompress from the workload.* 

-Like overworking at a gym, your mind can't take so much at once. especially from a fresh start. ease yourself into the workload and have little techniques to keep your mind learning at its best while keeping a steady flow of calm.

3.*Maintain a positive attitude.*

-Remember why you're doing this, think about how much better this environment is compared to the unsatisfaction you felt at a bad job. maybe the job was ok, but it wasn't what you were meant for. work towards that smile.
