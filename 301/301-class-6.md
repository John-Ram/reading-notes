## NODE.JS

>"Work smarter not harder."

Here's a question for you, what is easier: Working multiple things at once? Or tackaling each thing one by one? For me it's definitely the later and if you're the former then power to ya. This is one of the main advantages of **NODE.JS**, instead of handling multiple events at once on your web app, it tackles it all one task at a time which may sound slow but remember that this happens faster than you blinking. Node is designed on chrome's v8 engine and is the peanut butter to Javascript's jelly, since it all works primerily on Javacript, you don't have to learn everything from scract to get it working for you.  

Most other languages have to translate their scripts then run the commands, Node skips this and allows for a quicker server barring it doesn't get overloaded with tasks. one largew downside mainly for newbies is that it's sensitive to errors as it runs one thing at a time so you wanna moniter this stuff carefully.
