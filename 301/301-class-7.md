*Code 301: Class 7*

I find it funny that according to the two brothers, the only thing stopping Skynet from destroying humanity is that humans haven't mirrored verb syncronization for machines. Though according to google's study on team compatability it shouldn't be too surprising. 

What I mean is that like humans not being able to get along in a group even with similar backgrounds. *HTTP* and the works of Roy Fielding though with great potential are often subject to human ego. Rather than work together with their combined skills, many would rather try to reinvent the wheel. It doesn't help that while the internet is used everywhere around the world, only a small chunk seek to know how it works, and fewer know how to use it to it's fullest potential. Most just think that *HTTP* is used to send them to a website, when it's really so much more than that. *HTTP* is a resource collector, the website and it's contents the resource. But it has to translate the different coding languages used to access their works.

The brother's mention how not all computer languages share the same nouns or verbs, that there isn't really a machine language. So write now the web is more like a community working together towards different goals and each basically has a translator with them at all times. But Fielding's work has the potential to remove the need for the translator and allow the community to speak the same language improving it's performance and capabilities.
