## Heroku Deployment

*Code 301: Class 1*

This one is gonna be a shorty, Up til now we have gone through our coding journey using the magics of github pages. but after long hours of screaming at our monitor (or plural if you have multiple) we will finally be able to make a blog where we can tell our 5 followers the trials and horrors of the coding world and the immense satisfaction from being able to google our solutions. Heroku is our hero and with it we will be able to deploy full websites for the world to see. And with it a new companion called node.js which will be one of our main tools in working on our web servers. 

A good intro for ye would be [How to Node](https://howtonode.org/deploy-blog-to-heroku) a blog that talks in better detail about the wonders of node.js and it's mistress heroku. I'm looking forward to learning to use this in detail in a few hours as it is 0121 and my fumes are running on fumes. So until next time au revoir.
