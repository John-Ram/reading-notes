## SQL

*Code 301: Class 8*

**SQL**, or *Structured Query Language* is at its simpliest a giant spreadsheet of information, there are catagories and rows but on it's own it isn't reorganized when new information is added. it all gets added but it isn't until you tell it by imputing "ORDER BY" and "SELECT" your columns that it become organized to what you're looking for. 

SQL is used in many different forms all sharing the same basic styling and purpose. But what makes it popular is that its an easy way to store large lists of data for a company or webserver in simple format. And in an ever changing environment like say a small shipping company this could be a great way to store information about employees and stoked items.

SELECT column, another_column, â€¦
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC;

Above is an example of some of the syntax you would run to you'd look for something like crunch bars from the chocolate table where milk and white chocolate show up in order of year produced. This is some of the basics but you can also add or delete information which if you wanna learn how then go [here](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/introduction).
