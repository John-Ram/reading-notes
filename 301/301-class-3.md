## Flexbox and Templating

Flexbox, one of the alternatives to floats and the Xbox to CSS Grid. Both of their advantages in the field, FLexbox feels more user friendly as with has less command like *justify-content* and *order* to manipulate your content. Grid however lets you get into the nitty gritty on your specific IDs and classes but requires more setup to do so. Flexbox you tell the page this is what you're using and boom you're off. 

An important thing a good developer should always do is plan ahead how they want to make their page look, how to achieve it, and what tools to use. I feel like Flexbox is very useful when you dont have too much content is beung presented and you are the only one working on said page. FLex-box from first hand experiance is not too compatible with other CSS tricks and thus you have to be careful where you use what.
