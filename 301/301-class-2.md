Two minds are better than one, that is Programming of the Pairs in a nutshell. The point is to be more effeficient in our writing as this allows someone who is just focusing on writing code to not have to worry too much about typos as their partner is right there to immediately tell them there is one vs when they get together for mutual code review and go "ohh noo we need to fix this and thaat!" The coder is an introverted animal by nature in a social world, pair programming is the solution for allowing the coder to interact among it's peers while keeping to it's natural environment. As the stereotype on coder's hiding in their basement only coming out at night to feed on the blood of the innocent dies off, more and more sociable developer's emerge from the shadows. Companies don't just want someone with the proper skills, they also want someone who can comfortably integrate for peek efficiency from the team. Nowadays, it has become vital for the coder to be able to translate their product and it's syntax to someone whose not familiar with our sorcery. This way the customer can understand the process and difficulty of an otherwise 'simple' idea they had for their product.

Speaking of simplicity, **jQuery**, a library in the **javascript** arsenal that helps bridge the the factions of front-end and back-end developers to come together with a common language. not only does jQuery make writing simpler for the back-end developers but also allows greater precision in selecting their targets. For the Front-enders they are able to write javescript and manipulate their browser all in one go as jQuery can animate and create content for their front page allowing for less time going file to file and more of getting all the core bits done on one spot. as the saying goes, time is money and for coder's every minute counts. so jquery is Costco of javascript. you get more, for less.
