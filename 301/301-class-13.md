Form submission is one of the core links between a server and a client, the Client makes the request of certain information and the server well, serves it. There a couple ways to deliver the information, these are known as the GET and POST methods. 

The GET method sends the data you made or requested exposed and can be seen through the url especially if its within the same page. If you're doing a simple search then this isn't so bad and won't cause any harm. the issue lies in instance you try to use this method to send sensitive information cause now your sensitive info is easily visible.

This is where the POST method comes into play. Whenever you want to send sensitive info like a username and password then this is your solution as it sends in the request body vs the url so it's concealed and out of view of potential hackers. You'd also want to use this method when you're sending or requesting large bits of data as URLs have a limit on their length.
