## EJS

*Code 301: Class 11*

EJS or *Embedded JavaScript Templating* Is an alternative way to provide HTML markup using using plain Javascript. Useful When making Apps it allows you to make your text more dynamic and easily adjustable which helps when you're on a team and you need to split the works. Its syntax is rather simple as well it's just "<%= %> and you write your respective text, link it to your file and badabing badaboom ye gots yeself a pizza text ona side of app-chovies. While its seems simple it feels for geared for the more Javascript savy individual which i be not me hearty. Javascript shivers me timbers, she be my white whale.

I'm sure it's quite useful especially if your making web apps, but i will need to see it in action more vs regular HTML and JavaScript before the final verdict. but combined with JQuery, you can basically make a whole web app with nothing but Javascript and it's relatives. It seems that whoever made this wanted to be able to make JavaScript more universal as a language to give more freedom for the coder. Sorry this is a shorter blog, it's a new subject that is more confusing than interesting at the moment. when i learn more i might come back here to update this.
