-As a Coder, it is important to not only have knowledge of the language you are going to write such as **HTML, CSS, or Javascript**. But to have a decent knowledge of the Script editor you are using and the commands you need to perform certain tasks. In this Class, **Git**, **Ubuntu**, and **Vscode** were my tools and I will explain my experiance using them as one.

-Lets start off with a bit more detail on the *"Using them as one"* bit. You see, these three programs work together in harmony to help provide your results. "How?" You ask? Valid question. Git is a series of commands you imput to perform certain tasks such as: cloning a repository, updating it, then uploading the updated version you made. The upload process is known **Add-Commit-Push**. And something i like about it in my research is that apart from greatly reducing the risk or data corruption or loss, it also gives you the wonderful ability to work on you code offline then post it on you're ready and connected to the internet.

-How does it do that? that's where Ubuntu comes in. This posting for example, could not be made or posted without the use of all three three programs. The post is connected to a my website on Github, but in order to post this, I first had to write it on **Vscode**, then use the command *'git add blog title'* to tell **Ubuntu** that i want to update this file on my website the file is linked to. Next I would enter *'git commit -m "wrote a new blog for my site"* this is a **Git** command that tells the program "please include this message in the comment section to tell me or others what i updated in this post." which is great for record purposes. Lastly after my post is staged and commited it is time to upload it to my website for your viewing pleasure. To do this i'd enter *'git push origin master'* in **Ubuntu** and it will prompt me for my username and password for clearence to upload this onto my site. After entering that in. Poof. You watch some magic happen and like that you have this blog on the website for your reading pleasure. 

-The hardest thing is getting the programs installed, it's not smooth for everyone (wasn't for me) but once you have your tools and you begin to understand them and use them. it is a frankly enjoyable experiance (for me at least) and it'll start to become second-nature to use it. Like a blacksmith learning their tools, we too need to start somewhere.
