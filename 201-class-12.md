Charts, Pie charts, Radar charts, line charts, CHARTS! The official language of the corporate world. You can definitely write near 20,000 lines of meticulous code...ooor you can thank the fine folks over at [Chart.js](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/chart.js) for taking the time to do it for you so you can make a donut chart about popular donuts. But whatever you do 'donut' forget to credit them when you can. psst btw, something like that is called *library*. Pie charts are definitely the most popular, but all charts are helpful as they give you a visual representation of percentages. World of Warships has a Donut chart in the game that shows what ship types you play most, neet! 


Now if you wanna draw a picture on the internet or allow others to make a Doom-style game ye plug in the Canvas into your HTML and make designs on your page that you might not find on the web.[Developer Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_shapes) goes into great detail. Its a long read but afterwards you will have the knowledge you need to put triangles on the corners of your donut chart infested pizzaria page about what percentage of people prefer chicago-style pizza over new-york style. No matter your reason, it's always good to know the tools you have in order to make that website pop and sell your products.
