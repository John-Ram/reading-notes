## Operators and Loops

-Insanity is defined as *"Repeating the same thing over and over expecting a different result."*

-Because of that i consider Loops and Operators to be Insanity in code form. you are literally programming the system to repeat the same thing over and over until a different outcome is achieved. So why would we make our code insane? Lets say you imput the wrong password into your computer and it lets you in anyway. Thats pretty scary since that implies anyone could look up whatever virtual skeletions you have in your closet folder. 

-Operators and Loops are there to help avoid that metaphorical problem. A whole Loop is set to run the same prompt until you imput the correct information its looking for to get you out of the Javascript version of Groundhog day. A nice detail is that you can use different types of loops like **for/loops** to put a counter on your code block. This translated is you putting in your password wrong 5 times and now you're locked out. But hey your Closet folder is safe. there are other uses for loops, and there are more advanced parameters you can make for your website too, including adding messages that pop up after certain amount of tries or filtering results.

-But no matter what reason your adding insanity to your code, it's much more helpful on the web vs in your head. Just whatever you do, don't break your insane code, cause that'll break your computer and cause *you* to go insane.
