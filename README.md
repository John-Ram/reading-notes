**Growth Mindset**

>"Failure is the mother to success."

For me this quote summerizes the Growth Mindset, it lets you know that because you didn't succeed in one attempt, you are more likely to prevail in another. This will be tough, but the rewards are high.

Hi there, my name is John. whether this is being read by myself or by someone else, the most important thing is to face the world with a smile, and always strive to learn at least one new thing a day. after that, everything else is a bonus. I look forward to the challenges before me and the smiles i'll bring in this field of work.
