**Growth Mindset**

>"Failure is the mother to success."

>"Don't be afraid to fall."

For me these quotes summerize the Growth Mindset, they let you know that because you didn't succeed in one attempt, you are more likely to prevail in another. Coding is tough, but the rewards are high.

Hi there, my name is John. whether this is being read by myself or by someone else, the most important thing is to face the world with a smile, and always strive to learn at least one new thing a day. after that, everything else is a bonus. I look forward to the challenges before me and the smiles i'll bring in this field of work.
