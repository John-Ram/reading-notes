**Growth Mindset**

>"Failure is the mother to success."

For me this quote summerizes the Growth Mindset, it lets you know that because you didn't succeed in one attempt, you are more likely to prevail in another. This will be tough, but the rewards are high.

**To keep myself in the Growth Mindset i do the following:**

1.*Look up stuff like cars or boat on craigslist.*

-This aids my head in commiting to growth, as it allows me to see what i can gain when i succeed. It's like waving a treat to your dog, its more inclined to be trained.

1. *Allow your mind to decompress from the workload.* 

-Like overworking at a gym, your mind can't take so much at once. especially from a fresh start. ease yourself into the workload and have little techniques to keep your mind learning at its best while keeping a steady flow of calm.

1. *Maintain a positive attitude.*

-Remember why you're doing this, think about how much better this environment is compared to the unsatisfaction you felt at a bad job. maybe the job was ok, but it wasn't what you were meant for. work towards that smile.

Hi there, my name is John. whether this is being read by myself or by someone else, the most important thing is to face the world with a smile, and always strive to learn at least one new thing a day. after that, everything else is a bonus. I look forward to the challenges before me and the smiles i'll bring in this field of work.
