-When I was in High School I went to Disneyland for my Drama Class Field Trip, we got to have fun around the park because our teacher was a former employee. The park itself wasn't the highlight of my day. It was after watching the Aladdin show (which should really be called "**The Genie Live! Oh and there's some other people I guess!**") and getting to go backstage and learn how the magic worked behind the scenes. That. Was the highlight of my day. As long as i can remember that has always been the case for me, I enjoy learning how stuff works behind the scenes and also the history of its development if applicable. So when i got to watch the [Code.org's](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=xnyFYiK2rSY&event=video_description&redir_token=Dy1s-Jo1VM5lEvMUBbcFxo1a46d8MTU5MzI1OTQ4OUAxNTkzMTczMDg5&q=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.org%2F) and learn how not only computers but also modern technology work, i was excited! I cannot pick a favorite because the information was amazing, i always wondered how even the simple act of typing works or how music could be posted on the internet. Now that i know, i feel happier and fullfilled, like reading a good book that you've wanted to read for a while and were not disappointed from it.

-As i stated above, creating a new technology isn't hard but refining it is. In the early 20th Century, computers were the size of a nice modern apartment and took minutes just to do simple math. Could you imagine waiting minutes just to figure out that 2+2=Fish!? I couldn't! Fun fact! US Battleships like USS Texas and USS Iowa had some of the most advanced computers for their times. They were used for targeting of the main guns and this technology was used all the way up to the Persian Gulf War! But back on land many other advancements took place shooting our technology forward to what it is today.

-While the 4 core features of what makes a computer have remained the same *"Input, Storage, Processing, and Output."* have stayed the same. The technology is far more advanced than it was 100 years ago. Binary has stayed the same over the years, but the circuits, processors, and forms of output have evolved. *"01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001"* means Hello! in Binary. it took me a minute on my pc to type it, but the circuitry and processors can translate that Binary code faster than you can blink. Where a 100 years ago computers were large and slow, today they are faster *because* they are smaller because the mechanical electricity in the circuits have to travel less at the same speed while processing more information.

-We take this for granted, but our convience came from the hard work for innovative and ambitious people. So go out there, learn and change the world!
