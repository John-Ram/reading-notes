-Whether its racing against Ferrari in a Ford GT 40, Carving a Terracota Warrior, or building a website from scratch, planning what you're doing and where you're going beforehand is key. Welcome to another diary in the journey of my perfect lap. Today we'll be talking about **HTML**, making a wireframe of what you want your base site to look like, and how you will get there. 

-So what is **HTML**. **HTML** is the structure of your web page, its content. You know how sometimes when your page is loading slow and you see all the writing you're used to but it's so basic with black letters on a white page? Thats **HTML**, the raw content of the page. It's **CSS** that makes it look pretty. We'll delve into **CSS** another time, our main focus here is **HTML**. Order to build a website from scratch you need to write your **HTML** code. While you can dive right in and knock it out of the park, especially if you're new to this, I wouldn't recommend it. That's where you create whats called a *wireframe*. Essentially it's a drawing of what you want your page to look like. Whether on a piece of paper or on Windows Paint, always make a Wireframe to visualize what you want your site to look like, where everything should go, maybe how you wanna go about doing that. If you're working with a team this'll definitely help everyone be on the same page keeping everyone in focus on what needs to be done. Doing so could literally save you hours of headache.

-Now that you've taken the time to plan out what your site, it's time to begin building is structure with **HTML**. A valuable tool when building your site no matter what stage is **Live Server** which is available on **Vscode**. What this does is as you're writing your code you can see exactly what you're doing in real-time and its even better when you have a second monitor cause you do not have to constantly switch windows. (Wish I had a second monitor.) 

-An important thing to remember whether you're writing **HTML** or any other language is that if you're stuck. Use Google to find a solution. As a former instructor of mine said *"I'm not teaching you to memorize the information, I'm teaching to memorize how to find it."* Ain't that the bloody truth. While that wasn't in a coding class it definitely applies here. 

So go ahead and draw that Wireframe and visualise your perfect lap.
