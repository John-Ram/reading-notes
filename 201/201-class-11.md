## Assorted Topics

So this blog is about various assorted topics, Flash being one of them, it was made back in 1995 (so it's as old as me) and gained a lot of popularity being used for building websites but has since almost died out thanks to the introduction of JavaScript and being unsupported by major companies like Apple and Youtube. However, This program has almost a cult following for animators and artists. My ex is a major artist and she praised it during every use. From what she told me, it is very user friendly for animations but from a programming perspective, JavaScript is easier and better to use.

However while flash is great for making pictures, it's not as good as CSS when it comes to manipulating them. With CSS you can make a picture gallery of your various products on your website while making them pop out with some 3-dimensional shadowing, oooor you can crank it to 20 and have it be like a colorful rainbow on a 90's style website. (i forgot the website's name so i couldn't link it.) Being able to manipulate your photos to be visually appealing is one thing, but can it help your site be more popular when being searched?

Yes they can, say your site is about potatos, if you add the word "potatoes" into the 'alt' of your picture, the web browser can bring it up to a user looking to find out more about potatoes. This is an off-topic technique of Search Engine Optimization or "SEO" which is very important when you want users to visit your site. It doesn't matter how good your product is if you don't market it well right? Ask people how to make your site more appealing to make them want to stay or comeback. Your website is your product and you are always having to sell it to people with every click they make.
