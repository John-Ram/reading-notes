## HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions

*Code 201 Class 2*

After one week of intermission of code 102 and 201 it feels like i am reading my textbook for the first time, yet everything i read before is returning from the depths of my mind almost forgotten.

In 102 we covered the basics of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. And maybe because it's been a week or we only learned the bare bones, i seem to have picked up a bit more from the second reading. 

For me it was mainly in HTML, for example; you can separate text using line breaks or *<br />* (really wish i found that before.) which allows you to put your text in different lines when showing the final product. it helps curve the need to use the cushions and paddings of **CSS**. It's important to know how to work it in **CSS** but having a better understanding of **HTML** definitely helps. 

With **CSS** and **JavaScript** it was mainly a refresher, a much needed one I'll admit. you still have your elements, Variables, and selectors. but it never hurts to go back and see if you missed something useful.
