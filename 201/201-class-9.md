YouTube, we all use it, we all enjoy it. While it looks so sophisticated on the outside, it still follows the 'simplicity' of asking for your username and password, uploading videos, and giving you the ability to create loops on that one song you enjoy a lot. That is because many events and triggers are written into its code to provide a very interactive experiance. such triggers can hovering over an icon or a thumbnail, imputing a video you wanna look up in the search bar triggering the autofill menu to pop-up. 

There are different types of imput in **HTML** , such as "<imput type="file"> which you could upload a video, document or music etc. you may notice that when you are asked to browse the file you wish to upload that the window looks like the documents section of your operating system, this isn't changable and provides a user-friendly experiance. you can even chance the submission button to look like an image you assign it like say a salmon if you wanted.

**CSS** as always controls the astetics of the browser, allowing you to control what bulletpoints you can use for your lists such as "list-style-type: lower-roman;" so you could make a list using lowercase roman numerals for a table of contents. you can heavily influence the usability and cosmetics of your site from listing to even cursor type. 

**JavaScript** can be programmed to call on code when an event is triggered. Like clicking a link can trigger the code follow a link, hovering over the thumbs up on a video can tell you in a little box "I like this". You can even control the programs that are called with the coordinates of your user's screen and the site's page. Just remember to bind your functions with the events needed to do so.
