Web design can be like espressing yourself in fashion, I personally like *casual but elegant*, I feel comfortable and I don't look like i've been locked underground for 13 years in the Ch√¢teau d'If. Thats why links in **HTML** are so important, it reduces the clutter of code that would otherwise be all over the place. what if you needed to work on your **CSS** and you had **JavaScript** imbeded in your **HTML**? It'd get annoying after a while eh. So do yourself a favor, Plug in that (Href="link") for that other webpage or **CSS** file and make your life simpiler.

**JavaScript** functions are a different animal though, to declare a function and tell it "tell me the dimensions of a rectangle" by inserting variables for "width" * "height" or creating a function for a math quiz. You can set the parameters for imput and order the code to return the result of the function using well.."return" and if you make a simple quiz asking 5 * 5 then your return is 25 since "*" is a multiplier. When starting out on this start small, understand the core of it then grow from there, otherwise you'll be knee-deep in a quicksand pit of hot **javascript** you'll fall over like a scared goat. that's baaaad.
