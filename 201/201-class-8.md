The layout of your page heavily impacts whether your user will stay or not. While the average page will be 1000 x 1000 pixels, the top 600 of the page will be where the key content will be with some near the lower end hinting to more relevant information is further down. This is called a *Newspaper Fold* and as the name suggests is because it expects the average reader to decide if they're interested in your page from the headlines on a folded newspaper.

With modern technology, we now use different devices with varing size screens to look up information on the internet. This means that websites now need to account different screen sizes and device types. For example, an Iphone might be able to see 900 x 800 pixels while a 18in laptop might be able to look at 1800 x 1200 pixels. So what they can see on a website can be very different. Depending on your layout and content, you might benefit from a *Liquid Layout* vs a *Fixed Layout*. A *Liquid layout* can expand and contract the information on your site to fit a screen while a *Fixed Layout* is the same no matter the screen size, like wikipedia.
