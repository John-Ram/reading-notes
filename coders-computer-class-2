## Read 2: Coder's computer

*Code 102 Day:2*



> "As you become more familiar with coding, you may want to add more
features to your text editor. Youâ€™ll want to accomplish more with
minimal effort. You want a text editor that can grow with you as your
needs grow."
> -The old Coder.

One of the most important tools in a coder's aresenal is the Text Editor, this allows you to write your code, make changes on the fly, and with the right features even help show mistakes and errors you encounter.
Why is this important? In the beginning of the industry, Coders had to rely on their wits and co-coders for these kinds of aid. Maybe the coloring of the text editor gives you eye strain.
Nowadays, our community has developed many different Editors some of which are compatible on different platforms. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for example, is compatible on Windows, Mac, and Linux which means that while you're using different operating systems, you're bridged together by the same editor.

Being able to get aid from any Coder is important, but what's also just as important is the Editor's ability to grow with you as you sharpen your skills. 
Compatability, ease of use, and customization are key features you should look for in your editor and while you can ask other their preferred software. It's you who should figure out your preferred software. 
Like using a sword, You need to feel as though that tool is an extension of yourself. This might not happen overnight and what felt good one day might not the next, but finding your best fit will help you.
