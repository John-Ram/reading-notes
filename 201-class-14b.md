## What Google Learned About Teams

Google did a study on making the ideal team for maximum efficiancy, sometimes the needs of a company align with the needs of it's workforce. More and more is this becoming the case and though a slow process, the way the workplace is evolving is what people 100 years ago dreamed. Something we take for granted. Though it's always been a factor to those lowest on the totem pole, the corporate world is seeing that a way to improve performance is for their teams to work together as people and not just as a pawn of something larger.

Google's study found that the most ideal group is one of various background with varing skils and traits. the reason is because with that, psychologically the playing field is even. People are would not be competitive due to experiance but personality, this mean't that there would be less chances of a hierarchy forming vs a group of similar  background and personality. This in turn allowed people to be more social gaining confidence to put out ideas that even though might not be the solution, could help them go in that direction. Case in point, the Yale school did a project about revamping their school store, the group brought out many ideas, some practical, some not so much, but in the end they agreed on a miniture gym which according to [This Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) is still there as of it's writing. 


Someone said that what we look for in our workplace is similar to what we look for in a relationship, I found that to be true in hindsight and made me realize how unsatisfied I was in my previous jobs. So I'm thankful to COVID, it helped me get out of a bad place and set the stage for me to come to Code Fellows.
