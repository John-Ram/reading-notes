## JS Debugging

**JavaScript** is a weakpoint of mine, but to become more proficient in it I must also understand the common reasons why my code may fail and how to fix it. Sometimes the problem can be something as simple as putting a capital letter in the Wrong part Of your code or putting a single digit quotation mark when you're using doubles. However problems can be far more complex, and may require the aid of another developer. Like writting a story, it's always good to have a second set of eyes to see your work to keep you in check.

But what if you're dealing with code that you suspect might fail? You can use *"Try, Catch, Finally"* statements to create custom error messages as well as fall back code to keep the script going when the site is live. This will help you identify issues later especially if you have console logs at the ready. The browsers even offer console tools to see the logs, tell you the error, and even tell you what file and line of code is at fault. Glad we have such awesome tools at our disposal vs. what coder's had during the moon landing missions.
