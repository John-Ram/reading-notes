## HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

*Code 201: Class 3*

Just as every line of a supersuit or a the latest fashion must be present able and perfect so must our code. Every program has it's power, **HTML**'s is it's ability to structure, to give order to your text. Whether its with unordered lines (<ul>) for bullet points. Numbered lists (<li>) to count how many reason's Buddy was a wonderful villain. Or definitions ( <dl> <dt> <dd>) to show the definition of a great family film and that definition is *The Incredibles*!

**CSS** in the meantime can control the boxes of each code, the borders, their color: 

-example {
  Color: red;
  Border-radius: 15px;
  Border-color: yellow;
  font-color: white;
}

Above I just said " make my yellow on the outside, red on the inside, give the yellow an thin lining, and make my words white." **CSS**, the Edna Mode of Coding.

And lastly the wonders of **Javascript**. Say you wanna make sure your user can count before watching a funny cat video, well you can tell **JavaScript** to quiz them what 2+2 is (it's fish) and with the power of loops, you can make them repeat the quiz either as many times as you want or until they answer correctly. But remember, **JavaScript** in particular you have to be very specific with. Remember that Southpark episode when Nathan told Mimsy that he had to swim in the lake then blow a shark whistle? Well because Nathan didn't specifically say "swim into the lake *and* blow the whistle in the water." Mimsy came back and blew the whistle on land causing the shark to be friendly with Nathan. So when you set conditions for **JavaScript** remember to ad breaks to your code and set those conditions properly.
